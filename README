OVERVIEW
========

Pluginbox is a special Kannel box that sits between bearerbox and smsbox and 
allows plugins to execute and manipulate messages in both directions.

Pluginbox behaves similar to other Kannel boxes and share a compatible
configuration file format and command line options.

INSTALLATION
============
Please read the INSTALL file for further instructions. If in a hurry, the quick
explanation is:

./bootstrap
./configure
make

And finally, as root:

make install

You need to have a compiled version of Kannel available in order to compile
pluginbox.

The Userguide has also valuable information about the install and configuration
steps.
